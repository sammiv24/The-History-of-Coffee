# The-History-of-Coffee
## Inspiration
As sleep-deprived coffee drinking college students, we wanted to investigate and share the history of coffee.

## What it does
Lets you scroll through to explore the history of coffee.

## How I built it
We prototyped using Figma, and coded the webpage using HTML & CSS.

## Challenges I ran into
Designing and implementing the layout.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Being able to balance the web development project while completing our first freshman fall quarter.

## What I learned
To create a solid prototype before actually implementing the coding part.
